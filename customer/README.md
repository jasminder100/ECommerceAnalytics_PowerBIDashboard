# Customer Analytics Dashboard

# Context and purpose

1) This dashboard focuses on customers: who they are, how valuable they are, how often they come back, and where they’re located.
2) Use it to steer segmentation, retention, and market expansion decisions.

# Executive takeaways

1) Customer value skews toward the Premium segment, with Gold as the next‑largest contributor; Silver is smaller and Bronze is minimal. Classic value pyramid. 
2) Seniors are the largest age group, followed by Middle‑aged, then Young; gender mix is broadly balanced.
3) Repeat rate is trending down steadily from early 2023 through Mar 2024 (roughly high‑teens to low‑teens). That downward slope is the main risk signal on the page.
4) Customer concentration is strongest in North America and Europe, with meaningful presence in Asia and Australia; Africa and South America look lighter.

# How to read each visual and what to take from it

1) Customer LTV by Customer Segment (treemap)

  i) Larger blocks indicate a bigger share of lifetime value. Premium dominates, Gold is sizeable, Silver and Bronze are much smaller.
  
  ii) Implication: Protect Premium and develop a clear pathway to move high‑potential Gold customers up the ladder.
  
2) Total Customers by Age Group and Gender (stacked bars)

  i) Height shows total customers in each age group; the split shows gender mix.
  
  ii) Seniors lead in customer count; Middle‑aged are second; Young is the smallest cohort.
  
  iii) Implication: Ensure product mix and messaging fit the leading cohort, while building programs to grow the Young segment over time.
  
3) Repeat Customer Rate by Month (line)

  i) This is your health check for retention. The steady decline from 2023 into 2024 signals erosion in loyalty or engagement.
  
  ii) Implication: Without intervention, lifetime value and payback on acquisition will drop.
  
4) Total Customers by Country (map)

  i) Darker/larger areas indicate more customers.
  
  ii) North America and Europe are the strongest bases; Asia and Australia provide headroom; Africa/South America are under‑penetrated.
  
  iii) Implication: Near‑term growth can lean on the core regions, while targeted tests can unlock secondary markets.
  
# What this means for the business

1) Value concentration is good (a strong Premium tier), but we need an explicit Gold‑to‑Premium motion to keep value growing.
2) Retention is our pressure point. Arresting the decline in repeat rate should be a top priority.
3) Demographics skew older; acquisition and onboarding for younger consumers will matter for long‑term growth.
4) Geographic footprint is healthy; we can scale where we’re strong and test where we’re light—provided we protect margin and service levels.
