# Product Analytics Dashboard

# Context and purpose

1) This Product Analysis Dashboard shows how our categories and SKUs perform: sales, margin, quantity, and mix. It also includes an AI segmentation view to surface patterns behind “high” sales.
2) Use it to decide where to invest, what to fix, and which products to streamline.

# Executive highlights

1) Categories cluster between roughly 140K–210K in sales with profit margins in the low‑to‑mid 50% range. That means most categories are contributing with healthy margins.
2) Total sales in the current view are about 3.314M (see the Sankey). Clothing, Beauty & Health, and Electronics are the largest contributors among the displayed categories.
3) Margin quality looks consistent across categories; the job now is mix optimization and SKU‑level focus rather than wholesale category pivots.
4) AI “Top segments” flags three groups associated with higher average sales (≈27.3K, 19.14K, and 17.84K per segment), giving us a starting point for targeted plays.

# How to read each visual and what to take from it

1) Total Sales, Profit Margin (%), and Total Quantity by Category & Year (scatter, top‑left)

  i) X‑axis = total sales; Y‑axis = profit margin; bubble size = total quantity; color = category. The time slider lets you focus on 2022–2024 (the view shown is 2024).
  
  ii) What to do with it: Favor bubbles that sit far right (higher sales) and higher up (higher margin). If a bubble is big (high units) but lower on margin, that’s a pricing or COGS opportunity.

2) Total Sales by Category with ABC filter (stacked bar, top‑right)

 i) Horizontal bar shows total sales contribution by category. The y‑axis indicates the ABC class currently selected (here, “C” is active).
 
 ii) What to do with it: Use ABC to manage the portfolio—protect A items, optimize B, and rationalize or reposition C (long‑tail) items unless they serve a strategic role.

3) Total Sales by Category, Product & SubCategory (Sankey, bottom‑left)

 i) Traces value from Total Sales → Category → Product → Subcategory. In the current filters:
    a) Total Sales: 3,313,974.63
    b) Category contributions (examples): Clothing 597,493.86; Beauty & Health 570,471.68; Electronics 544,571.53
    c) Within Beauty & Health, example SKUs: Health Supplements Item ≈51,312.00; Skincare Item 95 ≈43,152.72; Health Supplements Item ≈36,941.68
    d) Subcategory example: Skincare ≈43,152.72
    
ii) What to do with it: Identify “hero” SKUs and subcategories to scale, and tail SKUs to fix, bundle, or sunset.

# Key Insights > Top segments (AI visual, bottom‑right)

  i)Answers “When is Total Sales more likely to be High?” It found three segments and ranked them by average sales.
  ii) Current output: Segment 1 ≈27.3K average sales (count 30), Segment 2 ≈19.14K (count 30), Segment 3 ≈17.84K (count 30).
  iii) What to do with it: Inspect the underlying drivers (e.g., region, channel, customer type, or product attributes). Use the top segment’s characteristics to inform         targeting, offers, and inventory allocation.
  
# What this means for the business

1) Margin discipline is holding across categories; the biggest wins now come from mix and SKU‑level actions rather than broad category shifts.
2) ABC analysis suggests a classic long‑tail: keep A items in stock and priced to value; test improvements on B items; clean up C items unless they have strategic value (entry price, traffic, or bundling roles).
3) The Sankey reveals clear product winners (e.g., Skincare Item 95 and high‑performing Health Supplements SKUs). These should receive supply priority and marketing support.
4)AI segmentation can accelerate targeting by pointing to combinations most associated with higher sales—use it to prioritize campaigns and assortments.
