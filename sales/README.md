# What the visuals tell us and how to read them

 ii) In this view, contributions are consistently positive, pointing to steady month‑by‑month accumulation. Use this to spot peak months and any negative dips when they occur.
 
 iii) Tip: Sorting by calendar order helps read seasonality at a glance.

  ii) In this snapshot, the largest bubbles appear in Europe and North America, with meaningful pockets in Asia and Australia. Use it to target growth markets and to check that margin quality holds across regions.

# What this means for the business

1) Growth and profitability are moving in the right direction at the same time—volume isn’t coming at the expense of margin.
2) Electronics is holding or improving margins year over year, which suggests pricing and mix discipline or cost improvements.
3) Geographic spread is healthy, with clear scale in Europe and North America and additional upside in other regions if margin guardrails are maintained.
