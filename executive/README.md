# Executive Dashboard

# Overview and purpose

1) This dashboard is our one-page health check. It shows performance at a glance—sales, profit, growth, product mix, regional mix, and customer mix. The Year and Quarter filters at the top let us switch the period for the entire view.

# Executive highlights

1) Sales: 3.31M from 5,000 orders
2) Profit: 1.71M, yielding a 52% margin
3) Average order value: 662.79
4) Growth: +50% year over year and +4% month over month
5) Active customers: 306 What this means: We’re growing strongly versus last year, maintaining healthy margins, and sustaining a solid basket size per order.

# What the visuals tell us

1) Monthly trend (Sales, Profit, Cost)

  i) Sales and profit build through the year and peak toward year‑end. This points to seasonality and the need to ramp inventory, service capacity, and campaigns ahead of the peak.
  
2) Category mix (bubble chart)

  i) Electronics is the sales leader with solid margins.
  
  ii) Beauty & Health delivers the highest margins—worth protecting and scaling.
  
  iii) Books and Clothing sit in the mid‑margin range—good performers with room for price, cost, or mix optimization.
  
3) Regional distribution (donut)

  i) East is the largest region (~24% of sales), with North (~21%) and South (~21%) close behind; West (~18%) and Central (~16%) are smaller but material.
  
  ii) Revenue is well distributed, reducing concentration risk and highlighting opportunity to lift the smaller regions with targeted activity.
  
4) Customer segments (pie)

  i) Gold represents the majority by count (~86%); Premium is smaller (~14%).
  
  ii) Next step is value confirmation: if Premium spends more and repeats more, we should design an upsell pathway for high‑potential Gold customers.
  
5) Product view (table)

  i) Quickly surfaces “heroes” with strong margins (e.g., Item 113 around 63%) and “fix‑me” items with thinner margins (e.g., Item 110 around 33%).
  
  ii) Use this to prioritize pricing, sourcing, bundling, or promotional actions at SKU level.
  
# Implications for the business

1) Performance is not just up; it’s profitable, with a 52% margin supporting reinvestment.
2) The category mix gives us both scale (Electronics) and high contribution (Beauty & Health).
3) Regional balance is a strength; we can pursue growth in Central and West without over‑exposing the portfolio.
4) A small set of lower‑margin products is pulling down the average—addressable through pricing and cost work.
   
# Immediate actions to consider

1) Invest and protect

  i) Allocate inventory and marketing to peak months and to category/region leaders.
  
  ii) Maintain price integrity and availability on high‑margin items (e.g., Beauty & Health).
  
2) Fix and optimize

  i) Tackle low‑margin, high‑volume SKUs first (pricing tests, vendor terms, pack architecture, bundles with high‑margin add‑ons).
  
  ii) Review Books and Clothing for mix shifts that raise margin without sacrificing volume.
  
3) Grow customer value

  i) Compare AOV, repeat rate, and lifetime value for Gold vs Premium.
  
  ii) If Premium is higher value, define a clear upgrade journey for top Gold customers; if not, build programs to lift Gold AOV and frequency.
  
4) Regional push

  i) Target Central and West with tailored offers and distribution support, ensuring margin guardrails.
